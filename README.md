MLP-GA 
First attempt folder: functions that aren't fully implemented, that I worked on initially but couldn't get to work, so changed my approach to the implemntation. COCO is files that are hardly modified, some early variation of a GA is in my optiiser but it doesn't work. 

Final folder: simple neural network-genetic agorithm hybrid. uses exampleData to produce results. also an earlier version of genetic algorithm before it was integrated into ANN. Some variables and code is different.

COCO: unzipped BBOB with an attempt in my optimser but it doesn't work.
